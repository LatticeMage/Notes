* Identify the strengths and weaknesses of each product or service: Determine the areas where your product or service excels and where it falls short in comparison to the competitors.
* Develop a strategy: Based on the analysis, come up with a strategy for positioning and marketing your product or service. This may involve highlighting the unique features or benefits of your product, addressing any weaknesses, or targeting specific market segments.
* Write the analysis: Organize the information you have gathered and analyzed into a clear and concise report or document. Be sure to include any relevant data or research to support your conclusions.
