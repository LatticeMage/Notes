A competitive product analysis is a report or document that compares and contrasts the features, benefits, and overall performance of a company's product or service with those of its competitors. It is typically used to identify the strengths and weaknesses of a product or service in relation to its competitors and to help the company make informed decisions about how to position and market the product or service.

Here are some steps to follow when writing a competitive product analysis:
* Identify the competitors: Determine which companies or products you want to compare your product or service to. This will typically include direct competitors as well as any indirect competitors that offer a similar product or service.
* Gather information about the competitors: Research the competitors' products or services in detail. This may include looking at their websites, reviewing marketing materials, and asking for demonstrations or samples.
* Analyze the competitors' products or services: Compare and contrast the features, benefits, and overall performance of the competitors' products or services with your own. Consider factors such as price, quality, reliability, customer service, and any other relevant features or characteristics.
* Identify the strengths and weaknesses of each product or service: Determine the areas where your product or service excels and where it falls short in comparison to the competitors.
* Develop a strategy: Based on the analysis, come up with a strategy for positioning and marketing your product or service. This may involve highlighting the unique features or benefits of your product, addressing any weaknesses, or targeting specific market segments.
* Write the analysis: Organize the information you have gathered and analyzed into a clear and concise report or document. Be sure to include any relevant data or research to support your conclusions.

By following these steps, you can write a thorough and effective competitive product analysis that will help your company make informed decisions about its products and services.
