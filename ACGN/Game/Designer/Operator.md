營運企劃設計問卷，做市場調查，設定受眾TA(Target Audience)  
尋找市面上優秀的作品，遊玩之後寫競品分析報告,同時也要分析遊戲核心玩法、核心機制  

這個職位是吸收了商業中PM(Product Manager)的概念  
重點在於做出TA喜歡，賣錢的產品  
營運企劃可能不算在開發部門而是隸屬商務部門下

Causual Game會需要強大的營運企劃，需要知道市場喜歡甚麼，能看數據改進遊戲玩法

## AI寫的如何寫一份遊戲競品分析
To write a good competitive product analysis of video games, you will need to research and gather information about the video games you are comparing. Here are some steps you can follow:
* Identify the video games you want to compare. This could be two or more games in the same genre or games that are similar in some other way.
* Research the features and gameplay of each game. Look at the game's website, watch trailers or gameplay videos, and read reviews to get a sense of what the game is like.
* Identify the target audience for each game. This will help you understand who the game is intended for and how it compares to other games in the market.
* Determine the strengths and weaknesses of each game. Consider factors such as graphics, storyline, gameplay, replay value, and other features that are important to the target audience.
* Compare the games to each other. Look at how they compare in terms of their target audience, features, gameplay, and other relevant factors.
* Write a summary of your analysis. This should include an overview of the games you compared, a comparison of their strengths and weaknesses, and your conclusions about which game is the best for the target audience.
* Consider adding any additional information or analysis that you think would be helpful to readers. This could include details about the developers, the marketing strategies for the games, or any other relevant information.


By following these steps, you can write a thorough and informative competitive product analysis of video games.
