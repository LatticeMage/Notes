# GameFlow

GameFlow is a model of player engagement and enjoyment in video games that was developed by game designer and researcher Marc LeBlanc. According to the GameFlow model, player enjoyment in a video game is determined by the balance between challenge and skill, which is often referred to as "flow."

According to the model, when a player's skill level is well-matched to the challenge of a game, they will experience a state of "flow," in which they are completely immersed and engaged in the game. On the other hand, if the challenge of the game is too difficult or too easy for the player's skill level, they may become frustrated or bored, leading to a decline in enjoyment.

The GameFlow model has been influential in the field of game design and has been used to inform the development of many successful video games. It is based on the concept of flow, which was first proposed by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and suggests that people are most engaged and motivated when they are challenged in a way that is appropriate to their skills and abilities.
